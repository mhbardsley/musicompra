# musicompra - music compression for practice

A common approach to practising music is to break a piece into sections, practise the sections, building up speed, perhaps practising each hand separately if applicable (e.g. piano practice). Finding the relations between notes, identifying commonly-used sequences and harmonic progressions is also used. Intuitively, the practitioner is trying to reduce the [Kolgomorov complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity) of the music they practise. This makes sense: if you can describe your music more efficiently, and can achieve all parts of that description, then you can more efficiently perform that piece.

This repository will be an attempt to generate short descriptions from long pieces of music to aid its practice.
